class_name MapManager
extends Node2D

## [M27C C2] Owns which maps are loaded and where they sit relative to each
## other. The thing that replaces "the current map is the scene you are in".
##
## THE POINT IS THE COORDINATE SPACE, not the loading. Every cell coordinate
## crossing this boundary is GLOBAL — a position in one tile grid shared by
## every loaded chunk — and each chunk knows the offset from that grid to its
## own local cells. Today exactly one chunk is ever live and its origin is
## (0,0), so global and local happen to be equal; C4 makes several live at once
## and the equality stops holding.
##
## Introducing the distinction NOW, while it is a no-op, is deliberate. The
## alternative is a player controller written against map-local cells that has
## to be re-plumbed once neighbours load — and the failure mode of getting that
## wrong later is silent, because everything still works perfectly on the one
## map you happen to be testing. That is why `_test_map_manager` registers
## chunks at NONZERO origins even though nothing does at runtime yet: an origin
## of (0,0) cannot tell a correct conversion from a missing one.
##
## What this deliberately does NOT do yet: derive a neighbour's origin from a
## connection's direction and offset, load neighbours, or unload with
## hysteresis. That is C4. C1 landed the data those need; this holds the shape
## they plug into.

## Keyed by the map's own directory name (`Route1_Frlg`), which is what
## `MapConstants` resolves a `MAP_*` constant to and what the baked scene is
## called — so a connection's destination and a loaded chunk are the same
## string with no third naming scheme in between.

## Returns false rather than pushing an error for an unbaked map: the corridor
## has 3 dangling connections and 20 unbaked warp destinations by design, so
## "not baked" is an expected answer a caller acts on, not a fault.
